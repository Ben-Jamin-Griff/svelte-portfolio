    description: "This project was created to make it easier for researchers to recruit human participants for research studies. It is essentially a jobsite, advertising research projects to willing participants. The site was created using the frontend framework svelte and sapper+webpack. The server uses a combination of polka and express, built on top of sapper's base code. The database is postgreSQL and the whole thing has been deployed to heroku with a heroku postgres database. Currently there is an issue with image uploads and I need to alter my local dev code to fix the deployed site.",
