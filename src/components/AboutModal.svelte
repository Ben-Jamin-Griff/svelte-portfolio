    <h1>More about me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Benjamin Griffiths. My professional background is in mechanical engineering, specifically applying engineering to sporting applications, but I’m currently pursuing a career transition towards software development. For the past 10 months I have been working as a software support engineer for the University of Salford, providing data processing support to research projects. The position has given me valuable insight into software development and has been supported by self-learning.
    <br><br>
I made the decision to pursue a career transition after continued exposure to software development tasks over the past 3 years. During my previous 2 roles I carried out data processing and analysis tasks using MATLAB and developed GUI’s for use by teams within both organisations. Since making the decision to work towards a career transition, I have been teaching myself web development technologies alongside the software support position. I’ve delivered working applications utilising the fundamental technologies HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript, along with JavaScript framework applications using React/Svelte and Node.js. I’ve focused my learning around fundamental programming concepts enabling me to quickly learn different technologies to suit specific applications.
    <br><br>
I’m enthusiastic, eager to learn and extremely hard working. Although I’m older than your typically junior, I believe that my previous work and industry experience gives me a better understanding of the commercial needs of businesses. I have also developed excellent interpersonal and relationship building skills, giving me confidence in communicating with both customers and colleagues.
    <br><br>
If you have any questions regarding my background and experience, please get in touch.</p>
